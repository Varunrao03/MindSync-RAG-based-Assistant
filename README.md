# Introduction

In today's information-rich world, researchers often struggle with information overload—spending hours sifting through papers, articles, and documents to find relevant insights. MindSync addresses this challenge by serving as an AI-powered research assistant that understands your questions and retrieves precise answers from your knowledge base. Built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, MindSync doesn't just search for keywords; it comprehends context, synthesizes information across multiple sources, and delivers intelligent responses that accelerate the research process. Beyond information retrieval, MindSync includes an interactive quiz feature that helps users reinforce and test their understanding of the concepts they've learned, transforming passive reading into active knowledge retention.

# Objective

The objective is to develop a RAG-based research assistant that accelerates and streamlines the research process for academics and professionals. Understanding that true learning goes beyond information retrieval, we've incorporated an interactive quiz module designed to deepen conceptual understanding and strengthen knowledge retention through active recall techniques.
